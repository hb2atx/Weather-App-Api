Flask/Python Weather App Api

I decided to create a minimal python weather app using the openweatherAPI.
It will have a database connected to the app.
The postgresql database store user register and Login information and also the city that has been searched.

There is also logout functionality so you dont have to re enter login credentials.

You have the functionality of deleting a city once you have viewed the weather.

openweather api = https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
